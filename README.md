------------

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* Bol.com API key ([read here](https://developers.bol.com/documentatie/aan-de-slag/))


Installation
------------

npm install bolcom
```

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/fvdm/nodejs-bolcom
```

Methods
-------

Each method below takes a callback function like this: `function( err, [data] )`.
In case of an error `err` is an instance of `Error` and `data` is not available.

For readability error testing is not included in the following examples.
See the [Usage](#Usage) section above for an example with proper error testing.


utils.ping ( callback )
----------

Simple API access test. The result `data` should be an *object* with only one
property named `message` with the exact value `Hello world!!`.

```js
bol.utils.ping( function( err, data ) {
  if( data.message === 'Hello world!!' ) {
    console.log('pong')
  } else {
    console.log('ouch')
  }


account.sessions ( callback )
----------------

Request a new anonymous session ID.

```js
bol.acocunt.sessions( function( err, data ) {
  console.log( data.sessionId )
})
```
})
```
